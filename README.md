# G-Notes
A note taking app made in Flutter. 
I got a couple ideas for the slogan "An app to write notes like a G" or a "note taking app for Geniuses" (still thinking of a better one).
The special thing about this app is that you should able to save your notes in your google account.
I had this idea when using samsung notes and they told me to login to my samsung account to save my notes in the cloud, immediately I thought "Who makes a samsung account", I would feel much better logging in to my google account which is why I decided to make this.
